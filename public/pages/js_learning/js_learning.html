<h1>What I've learned about Javascript:</h1>

<section>This semester has really helped solidify some of the things I learned last semester</section>
<section>Learning code conventions and overall how to write better Javascript is very important to me, since I feel we might have been "to free" to do what we wanted last year</section>

<h2>const VS let</h2>
<section>While I already knew that "var" is a no-go, I didn't think about the fact, that using let also could have consequences and comprimese the code<br>
By only using const, I've learned how many of my variables actually need reasigning, and will then later change them to let when required</section>

<h2>Callback functions</h2>
<section>There has been a lot of focus on using callback functions<br>
We use callback functions to pass a function as an argument in another function<br>
The most important part, is that we can run the callback function after another function has finished, making sure that the "code flow" doesn't break.<br>
For instance in our mappings:</section>
