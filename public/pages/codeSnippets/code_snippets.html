<section>For this project I created seperated my HTMl into fragments<br>
Then with a JS file I connected my HTML pages together and exported them:</section>

<section>Then I imported them in my app.js file, and used them for different getmappings:</section>

<section>This is also known as SSR(Server side rendering), meaning that it is the server that renders the HTML pages not the client</section>

<section>I've defined my port in my package.json file, with the use of a dependency called cross-env</section>
<img src="./pages/codeSnippets/scriptport.PNG" alt="Picture not found">
<section>Here the port is defined as 3000<br>
But if for any reason that port is blocked, my app.js file has a backup port - 6000</section>
