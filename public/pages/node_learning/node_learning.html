<h1>What I've learned about NodeJS:</h1>

<section>NodeJS is not a language, it's a server environment</section>
<section>It's build on the Chrome V8 javascript engine</section>
<section>It is a way to write Javascript, but it is 100% serverside</section>

<h2>So far; I know of 2 ways to initiate a NodeJS project:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Create a package.json file and make sure it's an empty json-file by writing "{}" in it <br>
    Then in your terminal you write the following:<br>

    npm is short for "Node Package Manager" - It will help install all necessary packages for your project.<br>
    Express or "Express.js" is the framework I've been working with so far, and is (to my understanding) the most common framework used when working with NodeJS.
    </li>
    <li>Another way to write:<br>
        <img src="./pages/node_learning/npm_init.PNG" alt="Picture not found"> <br>
        Here the program will help you fill out any information needed: <br>

<h2>Tools I've used:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Obviously I have installed Node (v16.13.2) <br>
        I use this for running my applications: <br>
        <img src="./pages/node_learning/node_app.PNG" alt="Picture not found"> <br>
        </li>
        <li>But in my node repository I've also installed the tool Nodemon<br>
        If I run my application using this tool instead, it will automatically restart my application everytime I change anything in the code.<br>
        This helps a lot on saving time, and not making stupid mistakes <br>
